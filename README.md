# Beertopia

#### 'Beertopia' was created to give functional use of Punk API. It allows you to search through the database to find your favorite beers, or types of beer. It Provides information about what best food pairs with the flavors, it provides what ingredients(Hops, Malts, Yeast) is within it and it provides other basic information about the chosen beer.

## How it works:

#### 1. Click through to the search bar and search a beer you would like to know more about. Whether it is a specific name, or if it is a specific type: IPA, ALE. ect.

#### 2. There will be a call to the API which will pull in the closest matching beer options in the database.

#### 3. Find the beer that interests you and click into it and learn.

## Download locally:

## Future Development Considerations:

1. Add in more filter options, such as: ABV, IBU and Brewed Date.

2. Build out a profile section to allow the user to save beer that they have searched for easier access.

3. Build out an option to add additional beer to the API.
